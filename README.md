# Hand Gestured Virtual Mouse 

This project implements a hand-gesture-based virtual mouse that allows users to control mouse functions with just their hands, without the need for any additional hardware. Using computer vision and hand-tracking techniques, the application detects hand gestures to perform basic mouse functions like moving the cursor and clicking. To detect Hand gesture movements this system make use of desktop webcam.This approach makes for a more natural and touch-free interaction with a computer, which can be useful for accessibility purposes, hygiene-sensitive environments.

The domain of the project is Artificial Intellegence and Machine Learning, the programming languauge is used is Python,libraries used are Mediapipe,opencv,pyautogui and IDE used is Pycharm.
